# HumanDetection

This is a practice of building a surveillance camera system.
It is built in python code with the OpenCV and haarcascade which is an open-source code presented by Intel. 

The surveillance camera will capture its surrounding images only when there are some people detected and saving the captured images in an appropriate file for further usages. For example, the images could be sent to the database or cloud depends on the user’s demand and size of images. Also, the image file will be named as numbers such as ‘0’, ‘1’ etc according to the number of people detected.

(To test this code one needs to create an empty file named as PhtoCapture)
